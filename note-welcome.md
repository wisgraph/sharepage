## What is ShareHub?

ShareHub is a tool that allows you to share your Obsidian notes via GitHub Pages. It supports:

- **Markdown rendering** - Full markdown support with syntax highlighting
- **Internal links** - Navigate between notes using `[[note]]` syntax

```

And some Python:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))
```
