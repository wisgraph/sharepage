# Dynamic Rendering Success!

If you are seeing this, the **Dynamic Rendering** logic is working correctly without waiting for GitHub Actions to build the static HTML.

## Key Features Tested:
- [x] Frontmatter parsing
- [x] Markdown to HTML conversion
- [x] Style application
- [x] Fast access via URL

You can now try adding this to your `_dashboard.md` to see it appear there too.
